# Documentation

You can learn more about the Deepgram API at [developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs).

# Getting an API Key

üîë To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

# Requirements

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version ^3.10)

> **_NOTE:_** Althought many older versions should work.

# Installation

```sh
pip install deepgram-sdk
```

# Quickstarts

This SDK aims to reduce complexity and abtract/hide some internal Deepgram details that clients shouldn't need to know about.  However you can still tweak options and settings if you need.

## PreRecorded Audio Transcription Quickstart

You can find a [walkthrough](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/pre-recorded-audio-transcription) on our documentation site. Transcribing Pre-Recorded Audio can be done using the following sample code:

```python
AUDIO_URL = {
    "url": "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav"
}

# STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the API key from environment variables
deepgram = DeepgramClient()

# STEP 2 Call the transcribe_url method on the prerecorded class
options = PrerecordedOptions(
    model="nova",
    smart_format=True,
    summarize="v2",
)
url_response = deepgram.listen.prerecorded.v("1").transcribe_url(AUDIO_URL, options)
print(url_response)
```

## Live Audio Transcription Quickstart

You can find a [walkthrough](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/live-streaming-audio-transcription) on our documentation site. Transcribing Live Audio can be done using the following sample code:

```python
deepgram = DeepgramClient()

# Create a websocket connection to Deepgram
options = LiveOptions(
    punctuate=True,
    language="en-US",
    encoding="linear16",
    channels=1,
    sample_rate=16000,
)

def on_message(result=None):
    if result is None:
        return
    sentence = result.channel.alternatives[0].transcript
    if len(sentence) == 0:
        return
    print(f"speaker: {sentence}")

def on_metadata(metadata=None):
    if metadata is None:
        return
    print(f"\n{metadata}\n")


def on_error(error=None):
    if error is None:
        return
    print(f"\n{error}\n")

dg_connection = deepgram.listen.live.v("1")
dg_connection.start(options)

dg_connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Transcript, on_message)
dg_connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Metadata, on_metadata)
dg_connection.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Error, on_error)

# create microphone
microphone = Microphone(dg_connection.send)

# start microphone
microphone.start()

# wait until finished
input("Press Enter to stop recording...\n\n")

# Wait for the microphone to close
microphone.finish()

# Indicate that we've finished
dg_connection.finish()

print("Finished")
```

# Examples

There are examples for **every** API call in this SDK. You can find all of these examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main/examples) at the root of this repo.

These examples provide:

- PreRecorded Audio Transcription:

    - From an Audio File - [examples/prerecorded/file](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/prerecorded/file/main.py)
    - From an URL - [examples/prerecorded/url](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/prerecorded/url/main.py)

- Live Audio Transcription:

    - From a Microphone - [examples/streaming/microphone](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/streaming/microphone/main.py)
    - From an HTTP Endpoint - [examples/streaming/http](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/streaming/http/main.py)

- Management API exercise the full [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations for:

    - Balances - [examples/manage/balances](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/balances/main.py)
    - Invitations - [examples/manage/invitations](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/invitations/main.py)
    - Keys - [examples/manage/keys](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/keys/main.py)
    - Members - [examples/manage/members](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/members/main.py)
    - Projects - [examples/manage/projects](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/projects/main.py)
    - Scopes - [examples/manage/scopes](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/scopes/main.py)
    - Usage - [examples/manage/usage](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/usage/main.py)

To run each example set the `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` as an environment variable, then `cd` into each example folder and execute the example: `go run main.py`.
